\title{Simulate group data}
\usage{
simulate_group(n_indiv, theta, infectionHistories, strainIsolationTimes,
  sampleTimes, nsamps, antigenicMapLong, antigenicMapShort, repeats = 1,
  mus = NULL, musIndices = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_indiv}{the number of individuals to simulate}

\item{theta}{the named parameter vector}

\item{infectionHistories}{the matrix of 1s and 0s giving presence/absence of infections for each individual}

\item{strainIsolationTimes}{the vector of strain circulation times (ie. possible infection times)}

\item{sampleTimes}{the vector of times at which samples could be taken}

\item{nsamps}{the number of samples per individual}

\item{antigenicMapLong}{the collapsed antigenic map for long term cross reactivity, after multiplying by sigma1}

\item{antigenicMapShort}{the collapsed antigenic map for short term cross reactivity, after multiplying by sigma2}

\item{repeats}{number of repeated samples for each year}
}
\value{
a data frame with columns individual, samples, virus and titre of simulated data
}
\description{
Simulates a full set of titre data for n_indiv individuals with known theta and infectionHistories. Each individual gets nsamps random samples from sampleTimes, and infections can occur at any of strainIsolationTimes
